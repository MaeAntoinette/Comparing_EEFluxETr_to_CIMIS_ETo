# Comparing_EEFluxETr_to_CIMIS_ETo
The EEFlux model calibrates remotely sensed estimates of actual ET to the reference ET (PET) of the given image's acquisition date. The model uses global climate grids to estimate PET and thus it is necessary to see how well its estimates compare to ground-observed data. I use CIMIS PET data (Penmain-Monteith ETo) to compare EEFlux ETr. The following scripts contain csvs which have my EEFlux PET data and CIMIS PET data.  This repository is a "work in progress". I am currently using the data to determine correction factors for my EEFlux data. So, the following scripts will be used to make plots at the annual and seasonal scales and will be used to determine if we need a time-varying regression. Download the EEFlux_ETr_stack file to get the ETr images used for the point data that was compared to CIMIS point data.
